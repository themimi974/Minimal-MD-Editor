## Overview

Minimal MD Editor is a modern, minimalistic Markdown editor built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s designed for a distraction-free writing experience and is especially handy when working with ChatGPT outputs—which are already formatted in Markdown. With real-time preview and convenient keyboard shortcuts, you can quickly polish your content and see exactly how it will appear once rendered.

## Features

- **Live Preview:** Toggle effortlessly between the raw Markdown editor and a styled preview window.
- **File Operations:** Easily load Markdown (`.md`, `.txt`) files into the editor and save your work with a custom filename.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Format your text on the fly using shortcuts like:
  - `Ctrl+B` for **bold**
  - `Ctrl+I` for *italic*
  - `Ctrl+L` for inserting links
  - `Ctrl+Alt+H` for wrapping code blocks
- **Elegant Design:** Enjoy a dark, modern interface that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
- **Perfect for ChatGPT Outputs:** Quickly edit, tweak, and preview ChatGPT-generated Markdown outputs with ease.
